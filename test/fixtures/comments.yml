      <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10508155">New Zealand Herald: Clark shelves fuel levy until 2011</a><br>
      <blockquote>The Government has applied the brakes on bringing the transport sector into its emissions trading scheme, with road users not being asked to pay higher fuel costs until 2011.<p>
      Under the proposed scheme, which is yet to be approved by Parliament, the transport sector was to begin paying levies from January next year - which might have added up to 8c a litre to the cost of fuel.<p>
      However, with world oil prices skyrocketing and Labour being sensitive to its imposing a further hike in the cost of petrol with an election looming, the Herald understands the Government is set to announce within days that it will push back the date that transport joins the scheme for two years.</blockquote><p>
      Helen Clark was just named a "champion of the earth" by UNEP for her work on getting NZ to finally adopt serious climate change policy. &nbsp;Will she be handing it back?<p>
      (I posted this on yesterday's thread just half an hour ago... guess I should pay more attention to what time it is in Europe)

      <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3876407.ece">Dashing Dane Anders Fogh Rasmussen favourite for president of EU - Times Online</a><blockquote><p> A dashing Dane with his own Facebook page has emerged as the favourite to thwart the ambitions of Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair of becoming the first "president of Europe".<p> Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Liberal Prime Minister of Denmark since 2001, has been described by Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy, as Europe's best-looking leader.<p> He is quietly gathering support as an ideal compromise candidate for the new role of president of the European Council, the forum in which EU leaders make decisions such as setting targets for greenhouse gases and biofuels.<p> Mr Blair had been widely described as a front-runner for the job created by the Lisbon treaty, which is due to start on January 1 and also involves representing Europe overseas. Although he has been backed publicly by President Sarkozy of France and may receive a boost from the re-election of his friend Mr Berlusconi, Mr Blair is not thought to have the crucial support of Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>CARBON capture and storage technology, which is central to the Federal Government's climate change strategy, is a mirage that is damaging efforts to develop renewable energy, a global report funded by Greenpeace has found.<p>
      The report was criticised yesterday by the resources industry and the mining union, which are relying on the technology to cut down emissions from coal-burning power stations.<p>
      The debate surrounding carbon capture and storage is intensifying as the resources industry attempts to bargain for concessions while the Federal Government ponders the design of an emissions trading scheme.</blockquote><br>

      In an extraordinary meeting with Fijian media executives in Suva yesterday, the self-appointed prime minister claimed that local journalists "hate" him.<p>
      And he insisted that deported Australian newspapermen Evan Hannah and Russell Hunter would not be allowed to return toFiji.<p>
      The comments by Commo-dore Bainimarama threaten to further damage relations between Fiji and Australia, with the Rudd Government describing Mr Hannah's deportation last week as a "reprehensible attack on human rights". </blockquote><p>

      Luxury hotels and golf: welcome to the Green Zone</a><br>
      <sup>Pentagon airs plan to turn Baghdad military redoubt into a chic urban oasis</sup><br>
      By Michael Howard, <em>The Guardian</em><p>
      <blockquote><br>
      <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img alt="Tigris Woods" src="http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l165/magblog/tigriswoods.jpg"><p>A plan by US military planners for the "Tigris Woods Golf and Country Club" in the Green Zone in Baghdad, Iraq. <br>
      Picture: U.S. Army/AP</p></td></tr></table><p>
      Picture, if you will, a tree-lined plaza in Baghdad's International Village, flanked by fashion boutiques, swanky cafes, and shiny glass office towers. Nearby a golf course nestles agreeably, where a chip over the water to the final green is but a prelude to cocktails in the club house and a soothing massage in a luxury hotel, which would not look out of place in Sydney harbour. Then, as twilight falls, a pre-prandial stroll, perhaps, amid the cool of the Tigris Riverfront Park, where the peace is broken only by the soulful cries of egrets fishing.<p>
      Improbable though it all may seem, this is how some imaginative types in the US military are envisaging the future of Baghdad's Green Zone, the much-pummelled redoubt of the Iraqi capital where a bunker shot has until now had very different connotations.<p>
      A $5bn (&#163;2.5bn) tourism and development scheme for the Green Zone being hatched by the Pentagon and an international investment consortium would give the heavily fortified area on the banks of the Tigris a "dream" makeover that will become a magnet for Iraqis, tourists, business people and investors. About half of the area is now occupied by coalition forces, the US state department or private foreign companies.</blockquote><br>

      You plant stuff, fertilize it, and it grows.<p>
      You chop everything down, haul it away, and it ain't there no more.<p>
      Gah-zounds, them's deep insights.<p>
      Here's a wild &amp; crazy idea: &nbsp;make the people who chop everything down and haul it away plant stuff and fertilize it. &nbsp;Golly-gee-whiz! &nbsp;Think that might, ya know, create a <strong>sustainable</strong> resource?<p>

The DNA tests also revealed that two additional skulls which some had claimed to be Schiller's also did not belong to the poet.</blockquote>"

He would like Brussels to have greater control over economic policy in euro zone countries -- and even wants its members to speak with one voice on the international stage.<p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,grossbild-1169863-551503,00.html\"></a><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,grossbild-1169863-551503,00.html\"></a> &nbsp;European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has some big ideas for Brussels. Opponents of the European Union claim that Brussels already has too much influence over the internal affairs of the EU's 27 member states. They are unlikely to be thrilled by the news that a leading EU official is calling for far-reaching new powers for the EU's executive branch when it comes to member states' economic affairs -- and even foreign policy.<p> EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner<a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,531287,00.html\"> Joaquin Almunia (more...)</a> wants the European Commission to have more clout in all areas of economic policy. In the future, the Commission should be able to supervise and coordinate reform efforts in the countries of the euro zone, in order to promote more competition in Europe's product and services markets, including the market for financial services. The proposals are contained in a report marking the 10-year anniversary of the euro which Almunia will present on Wednesday.<p> In the report, which has been seen by SPIEGEL, Almunia says the Commission should also have a hand in determining \"adequate wage developments, flexibility and security on labor markets.\" He also recommends setting up an early warning system for economic crises within the euro zone, so that counter-measures can be taken in time.</blockquote>"

    comment: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7384041.stm">BBC NEWS | Asia-Pacific | Burmese storm toll 'tops 10,000'</a><blockquote><p><b>More than 10,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that hit western Burma on Saturday, Foreign Minister Nyan Win has said on state TV.</b><p> He said his government was ready to accept international assistance. Aid shipments are now being prepared.<p> Thousands of survivors of Cyclone Nargis are lacking shelter, drinking water, power and communications.<p> The United States offered to increase aid offered if Burma agreed to allow a US team access to assess the situation.<p> First Lady Laura Bush, who takes a special interest in Burma, urged Burma to accept $250,000 (&#163;126,000) already allocated for emergency aid, and said more would be available if the team was allowed into the country.<p> She also accused the Burmese authorities of failing to give a "timely warning" about the approaching storm, after which five regions - home to 24 million people - have been declared disaster zones.</blockquote>

    comment: "<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/04/conservation.wildlife\">Rainforest seeds revive lost paradise | Environment | The Observer</a><blockquote><p>Six years ago the area around Samboja in Borneo was like much of the world's tropical rainforest: denuded. The trees had been cut for timber, the land burnt, and in place of what should be some of the richest biodiversity on the planet were thousands of acres of grass.<p>But from this ruined landscape a fresh forest has been grown, teeming with insects, birds and animals, and cooled by the return of moist clouds and rain. It is a feat that has been hailed by scientists and offers hope for disappearing and ruined rainforests around the world.<p>The secret was to use more than 1,300 species of local tree and a fertiliser made with cow urine, says Dr Willie Smits, the Indonesian forestry expert who led the replanting. 'The place became the scene of an ecological miracle, a fairytale come true,' says Smits, who has written a book about the project.<p>Rainforests are home to half the world's 10 million species of plants, animals and insects, store more carbon than the Earth's atmosphere, clean air and water and regulate temperatures and rains. But the UN estimates that every day more than 14,000 hectares (34,900 acres) of primary rainforest are cut down for timber or to make way for crops such as palm oil in south east Asia and soya in South America - a figure campaigners warn is 'conservative'.</blockquote>"

Other major political parties fear it would mark an \"Americanization\" of the country's security policy -- with the possibility of \"American-style\" mistakes.<p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,grossbild-1169436-551448,00.html\"></a><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,grossbild-1169436-551448,00.html\"></a> &nbsp;The conservative Christian Democrats in Germany are considering a security policy proposal that would encourage the creation of a missile defense shield over Europe. The party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to unveil a new foreign policy platform this week that would have as its centerpiece the goal of creating a missile shield to protect Europe from a nuclear attack, as well as provisions for extended missions by the German military abroad.<p> The controversial plan by the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) would seek to consolidate more foreign policy authority within the Chancellery, the German equivalent of the White House, by creating a National Security Council within the chancellor's office, which would have \"its own staff\" with the capacity to coordinate security policy. Critics say it could also represent an usurping of power from the German Foreign Ministry, currently led by Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the center-left Social Democratic Party, the CDU's junior partner in Germany's ruling grand coalition. Currently, the Foreign Ministry takes the lead on most foreign security policy issues.<p> The crux of the new policy paper, which has been seen by SPIEGEL in advance of its release, is that international terrorism represents the greatest threat to German security. The draft policy also calls for the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to be deployed domestically in cases of disaster and for the country to at least debate the issue of whether the parliament's constitutionally anchored responsibility for approving any Bundeswehr mandate is still appropriate today, considering the new challenges faced by Germany.</blockquote>"

While Arabs call the day \"the catastrophe,\" many Israelis aren't in the mood to celebrate. A look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares.<p><p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;\"> On May 14, 1948, the leaders of Palestine's Jewish population, the Yishuv, gathered in Tel Aviv's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing Jewish immigration: to establish the Jewish state propagated by the father of political Zionism, Theodor Herzl. The opportunity had finally arrived. Just hours before the British Mandate over Palestine came to an end and the British high commissioner left the country, David Ben-Gurion declared the founding of the state of Israel.<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;\"> &nbsp;<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;\"> The Israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next: from persecution and annihilation in Europe to latent war and open threats to their existence. For decades most people in the Middle East refused to accept Israel's existence, or even its right to exist. Israel's independence day became known as the<i> Nakba</i>, the catastrophe, in Arabic and continues to be called that.</blockquote>"

    comment: <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/26084">Food aid alone will not solve global food crisis, economist tells EU - EUobserver.com</a><blockquote> EUOBSERVER / BRUSSELS - The EU should provide structural aid to increase yields from peasant farmers in poor countries if it wants to help the global food crisis rather than just throwing emergency food aid at the problem, American economist Jeffrey Sachs told the European Parliament on Monday (5 May).<br><br> "If we just stay at the level of emergency food aid, we will not solve the problem," said the economist who is instead urging the bloc to look at ways to help farmers boost food production.<br><br> Emergency food aid is a response that should indeed be applied, he said, but "in the most short term" with a "time horizon of just the next six months. It won't solve anything longer term. For a longer term solution, we need to address the structural supply."<br><br> "Rather than just shipping expensive food aid, we should be helping the poorest of the poor to grow more food."</blockquote>

      from the article:<br>
      <blockquote> Carlo Petrini, the founder of the Slow Food movement, said that there was "no need to panic. It would be terrible to abandon our Mediterranean diet just because the price of pasta has gone up a bit." He suggested that the answer was to eat less meat. </blockquote><p>
      Ultimately, this is inevitable, with only benefits on nearly all levels. More crop land for people food, more water for people, less cow and hog farts and feces to deal with, less cancers of nearly all types.<p>
      <blockquote>One ingredient of the Mediterranean diet - olive oil - has held its own, with sales rising by 1.5 per cent. </blockquote> <p>
      Sales may be rising, but the cost of olive oil has ascended over the last couple years by (my guestimate) 50%. I remember buying extra virgin cold pressed at 3.50 a liter 2 years ago, and now it hovers at 5 and peaks at 5.50. <br>

      Well, yes and no.<p>
      I don't see why the fact that people working in public services choose to use a car should be counted as part of my footprint. When I choose (as I do) to go to work by public transport, that is my individual consumption I'm reducing, not that of the company. Ditto when I take a train rather than flying.<p>
      Collective action is more often than not the sum of individual acts.

      Tough question, sad trend. A well-established one. Your company seems to have made a pretty compassionate choice in their reaction.<br>
      I have wondered about this too, and I think there is a connection with self-esteem and social mobility, feelings of powerlessness and worthlessness. I think the current fashion for multiple punctures of the body, Goth as death fashion, all tie in with treating yourself badly--because you feel badly about yourself.<p>
      Jerry Farber wrote a book called "The Student as Nigger" in which he pointed out that a system that taught racism on the concealed, implied level victimized the white student as well as the black,---because that white student became a bigot as a function of concealed values he or she was not well equipped to spot, and therefore resist even if he was not before. I oversimplify of course- good little book, far better than my tiny paraphrase.<p>
      Imagine you live in a place where economic divisions are growing rapidly in such a way that the majority of young people will never make as much money or have the status level of their parents. Imagine that you are growing up at a time when your parents are, far from overprotecting you, --just flat absent,-- working most of your life. Imagine that you are living in a warming world, in which there is a trash dump, a giant plastic "gyre" 6,000 miles wide out where the pure pacific ocean currents used to flow, where------- <p>

      I think that kids do need to develop a sense of personal safety from their personal lives.<p>
      &nbsp;I look back on some of the antics of my youth where, quite frankly, situations could have turned out otherwise and I'd not be here. Yet each one was a learning experience and I didn't do that or even that class of thing again. I wonder if sometimes we live in a world where kids are wrapped in cotton wool to the extent that they never develop the capacity to hear the voice in their head that says "don't, this is stupid".<p>
      The biggest carnage comes from cars. Kids as drivers never seem to realise that they are in control of a deadly weapon, one just a likely to kill them as anyone else. Too many are taught the basics of vehicle control, but are left to fend for themselves in traffic and we hope they'll work it out along the way. Some do, but many don't or become so fixated on the technical control thing that they are indifferent to what havoc their presence wreaks.<p>
      In Bulgaria there is a habit of putting up death notices on posters with pictures around town. It is hearbreaking to realise that most of them are either over 50 or between 18 - 25, almost all of the latter are from car crashes.

      You see those kind of markers all over in France too-but without the personal details, just the reminder that someone(s) died here on the highway. A salutory effect? Probably. And we were indeed talking about safety with dodo.<br>
      "Youthful indestructibility" is the eternal cliche'. But kids with a bright future --who KNOW they have a future- seem to have an internal alarm--a warning that says, <br>
      <i>"Don't wanna miss all that good stuff,-- better cool it"</i><p>
      kids who don't believe in their future may not care as much, or have that warning.<br>

      I should have added:<p>
      The most frequent foolish behaviour accident is one hitting all ages, practically since railways exist, and perhaps with a <i>decreasing</i> trend: those resulting from jumping on/off running trains. What's more, at least in the developed world, it may cease completely, though not because of 100% of people wisening up, but the spread of automatic doors.

      <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06gas.html?pagewanted=all">States Get In on the Calls for a Gas Tax Holiday</a><p>
      <blockquote>... state gas taxes, which run as high as 45.5 cents a gallon, often add far more to the price of gas than the 18.4-cent federal excise tax and are the primary cause of price disparities across state lines. So lawmakers and candidates at the state level have been getting into the act. &lt;...&gt;<p>
      At gas stations here in Alabama and across the country, support for the tax suspension plans was tepid. Echoing the findings of a recent New York Times poll, most described the proposals as obvious electioneering.<p>
      "It's just politics," said J. Vincent Schmidt, 23, of Panama City, Fla. "If they take the taxes away on gas, they'll probably find someplace else to stick it in." &lt;...&gt;<p>
      Few seemed soothed by the prospect of saving a few cents per gallon over the summer.<p>
      Mrs. Laster, after filling up in Alabama, said the plans would probably not cause enough of a price drop to ease her financial anxiety. Or would it?<p>
      Jeff Hamilton, the owner of a small gas station in Graceville, Fla., just a few miles away, said that when it came to gas, Americans did not necessarily behave rationally. A few pennies at the pump can mean a lot.<p>
      "It's all psychological," Mr. Hamilton said. "People don't understand that if they drive a few miles to get gas that's a little bit cheaper, they lose money."</blockquote>

      The article implies that this includes his share of the carbon used to construct roads for him to drive on, the military to defend him from terrorists and so on. It's not the amount that he's really using.<p>
      They also mention that a (U.S.?) Buddhist monk in the forest has a footprint of 10.5, significantly more than a homeless person.

    comment: Yes... That is very important, underlining the necessity of large scale <em>collective</em> action, and putting <em>individual</em> 'choice' in its proper marginal spot. Reducing carbon emissions will not and cannot be an individual 'virtue', because the common infrastructure in the 'West' accounts for such a large amount.

      AP via IHT: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/05/news/Belarus-US.php">Belarus accuses US of running spy ring amid escalating tensions</a><p>
      <blockquote><br>
      MINSK, Belarus: Belarus on Monday accused the United States of recruiting citizens into a spy ring aimed at undermining the ex-Soviet republic.<p>
      The U.S. State Department said the allegation was "just ridiculous" and that the department was considering whether to close its embassy in Minsk.<p>
      Most of the diplomats were expelled after the U.S. imposed sanctions on a state-controlled Belarusian company and travel restrictions on President Alexander Lukashenko and other top government officials.<br>

      <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/world/asia/06china.html?pagewanted=all">China Petrochemical Project Opposed</a><blockquote><p>Residents took to the streets of a provincial capital over the weekend to protest a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant backed by China's leading state-run oil company, in the latest instance of popular discontent over an environmental threat in a major city.<p> The protest, against a $5.5 billion ethylene plant under construction by PetroChina in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, reflected a surge in environmental awareness by urban, middle-class Chinese determined to protect their health and the value of their property. A similar protest last year, against a Taiwanese-financed petrochemical venture in Xiamen, in China's southeast, left that project in limbo. &lt;...&gt;<p>
      Organizers circumvented a national law that requires protesters to apply for a permit by saying they were only out for a "stroll." &lt;...&gt;<p>
      "We're definitely inspired by the events in <a href="http://www.danwei.org/blogs/xiamen_demonstration_today_liv.php">Xiamen</a> and <a href="http://www.eurotrib.com/comments/2008/1/13/0852/84208/16">Shanghai</a>," said the critic, who asked to be identified only by her family name, Wu, because she said she worried about attracting the attention of the authorities.</blockquote>

      <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/world/asia/05turkmen.html">A Turkmen Dismantles Reminders of Old Ruler</a><p>
      <blockquote>A 246-foot tall, rocket ship-like monument to the late ruler of Turkmenistan, topped with a golden statue of himself that rotates to always face the sun, will be removed from the center of the Turkmen capital, state news media there have reported. &lt;...&gt;<p>
      The president had already reversed Mr. Niyazov's order renaming the days of the week and months of the year in honor of himself and his family. He had also ended the bans on opera, ballet and the circus, which Mr. Niyazov had decreed un-Turkmen, and lifted restrictions on the Internet. &lt;...&gt;<p>
      Although the country was widely considered a joke abroad, the reality was not humorous. Most of the population lived in abject poverty. The country's health and education systems were eviscerated.</blockquote>

      <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/06/ukcrime1">CCTV boom has failed to slash crime, say police</a><br>
      By Owen Bowcott, <em>The Guardian</em></p>
      <p><blockquote>Massive investment in CCTV cameras to prevent crime in the UK has failed to have a significant impact, despite billions of pounds spent on the new technology, a senior police officer piloting a new database has warned. Only 3% of street robberies in London were solved using CCTV images, despite the fact that Britain has more security cameras than any other country in Europe.<p>The warning comes from the head of the Visual Images, Identifications and Detections Office (Viido) at New Scotland Yard as the force launches a series of initiatives to try to boost conviction rates using CCTV evidence. They include:</p><ul>
      <li><p>A new database of images which is expected to use technology developed by the sports advertising industry to track and identify offenders.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Putting images of suspects in muggings, rape and robbery cases out on the internet from next month.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Building a national CCTV database, incorporating pictures of convicted offenders as well as unidentified suspects. The plans for this have been drawn up, but are on hold while the technology required to carry out automated searches is refined.</p></li></ul></blockquote>

Verdant new developments of plush pastel vacation homes beckon buyers from Britain and Germany. Golf courses - 54 of them, all built in the past decade and most in the past three years - give way to the beach. At last, this hardscrabble corner of southeast Spain is&nbsp;thriving.<p> There is only one problem with this picture of bounty: This province, Murcia, is running out of water. Spurred on by global warming and poorly planned development, swaths of southeast Spain are steadily turning into&nbsp;desert.<p> This year in Murcia farmers are fighting developers over water rights. They are fighting each other over who gets to water their crops. And in a sign of their mounting desperation, they are buying and selling water like gold on a burgeoning black&nbsp;market.<p> \"Water will be the environmental issue this year,\" said Barbara Helferrich, spokesman for the European Union's Environment Directorate. \"The problem is urgent and&nbsp;immediate.\"<p> \"If you're already having water shortages in spring, you know it's going to be a really bad&nbsp;summer.\"</blockquote>"

      <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23776732-20142,00.html">Harsh internal audit of IMF calls for major reform | The Australian</a><blockquote><p><strong>THE International Monetary Fund has come under a withering attack from its own internal self-policing watchdog, which demanded far-reaching reforms to improve its effectiveness and accountability to member countries.</strong> The IMF was accused of failing to adapt to changing global realities, and of being widely perceived as both slow to respond to emerging world issues, and as ineffective in agreeing and delivering strategies to tackle these problems.<br><br> The charges were levelled in a report from the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office, the IEO, which called for action to bolster the legitimacy of the fund's top governing bodies and tougher international oversight of its day-to-day management, led by its managing director.<br><br> The report said that an overhaul of the fund's operations and governance also needed to go still further than a recent spate of reforms of its 185 member countries' voting rights, which gave some increasingly important emerging market countries a bigger say in decision making, reducing the traditional dominance of the United States and Europe.<br><br> "Our evaluation finds that reforms have not kept pace with broader changes in the environment in which the fund operates," Tom Bernes, the head of the IEO, said. "In our view, if left unaddressed this could likely undermine effectiveness over time."</blockquote>

Since the beginning of 2008, marine fuel has jumped 30 percent.<p> French fishermen began launching work stoppages and blockades three weeks ago. Since then, fishermen in&nbsp;Italy, Spain and Portugal have also gone on strike. There have been calls for governments to abolish the tax on diesel to bring down the prices and for more subsidies.<p> In northern Spain, fishermen were in a dilemma. They can't continue to make a profit with high oil prices, but they also can't afford to stay home at the beginning of tuna season.<p> Tuna brings in 80 percent of the revenue, said Patxi Martinez, a local boat owner.</blockquote>

He speaks to SPIEGEL about the coalition forces' ties with warlords, rumors about his family's influence and why he believes dirty deals are sometimes necessary.</strong><p> &nbsp;Taliban militants are a resurgent force in Afghanistan.<b> <p>SPIEGEL:</b> Mr. President, much has been written about the failures of the international community in Afghanistan. But a good part of the so-called insurgency in the south and east of your country appears to have more to do with a protest movement against a bad government and corrupt elite. It doesn't seem like much of an exaggeration to talk about a resurgence of the Taliban. Is it not true that many Afghans are only joining the Taliban because they don't consider them to be corrupt?<p><b> Hamid Karzai:</b> I disagree. That is absolutely wrong.<p><b> SPIEGEL:</b> Some Afghan people say that the president himself, who is appointing high-ranking officials in Kabul and in the provinces, is fueling the insurgency with these personnel decisions. Is that there any truth in that?<p><b> Karzai:</b> Governance has improved immensely in Afghanistan. For the first time in six years, the Afghan budget has become transparent, there are no longer any secret funds. Before, the governors did whatever they wanted. Now there is a reporting requirement and there are former governors who were criminal or corrupt who are now in prison, like the former governor of Baghdis province. Of course the country needs more time, but the problems we have in the south and east are not because of bad governance.</blockquote>"

"We have notice a slight decrease in quality."<p> The UK in particular saw a ten-fold increase in areas not complying with European hygiene standards, with the number of 'dirty' beaches climbing from 0.4 percent in 2006 to 3.5 percent the last year.</blockquote>

Contractors would provide more than 100 linguists with secret clearances and deliver food to Iraqi detainees at a new, U.S.-run prison.<p> The proposals reflect multiyear commitments. The mentor contract notes that the<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Armed+Forces?tid=informline"> U.S. military</a> "desires for both Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense to become mostly self-sufficient within two years," a time outside some proposals for U.S. combat troop withdrawal. The mentors sought would "advise, train [and] assist . . . particular Iraqi officials" who work in the Ministry of Defense, which runs the Iraqi army, or the Ministry of Interior, which runs the police and other security units.</blockquote>

    comment: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/02/europe/politicus.php">Sarkozy has a chance to leave big mark on Europe through EU slot - International Herald Tribune</a><blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.iht.com/#" id="articleLocation">BRUSSELS</a>:</strong> The European Union could hardly be hurt by a dose of ambition, leadership and a little&nbsp;brashness.<p> So along comes France next month, holders until 2009 of the EU's agenda-setting presidency, armed with the seeming requisites for putting Nicolas Sarkozy's mark on Europe and asserting French pre-eminence in steering its&nbsp;affairs.<p> How could the EU resist? Bland to the bone, some of its doubters say, Europe will find a way. Others see France already tangling its feet in the wires linking its own desire for the prestige of leadership with its difficulties in projecting French motives as open and&nbsp;selfless.<p> Traditionally, the rotating presidency of the EU has given its big countries a chance to assert their importance, or indispensability, as the motor of its destiny. They can try to do it through practical programs meant to create consensus and public appeal. A spritz of grandeur is not&nbsp;unwelcome.</blockquote>

"The situation is desperate and potentially more destructive than our recent battles with all the Horsemen of the Apocalypse&nbsp;combined."</blockquote>

He turned informant and gave evidence against a suspect at a court hearing two weeks ago.<p> "The case is even more serious than previous ones. This was a businessman from the Caserta area (of Naples) who, although he had colluded with organised crime, was helping investigations,'' said anti-mafia investigator Franco Roberti.</blockquote>

It declined after the opening of EU-Turkey accession talks in 2005, hitting lows of 30 percent in 2006, before creeping up to the 50 percent mark in late 2007.<p> "If it is constantly discussed in a general way whether Turkey belongs to Europe or not, then this will fuel Turkish people's feeling of not being wanted," Turkey's foreign minister, Ali Babacan, told German newspaper FAZ in an interview Sunday (1 June).</blockquote>

A court in Britain appears to have wounded German pride by awarding British tourist David Barnish &#163;750 pounds (&#128;948/$1,484) in compensation because there were too many German tourists at the Greek island hotel where he spent a family holiday last August.<p> Barnish had sued holiday company Thomson because it hadn't told him the Grecotel resort on the island of Kos was occupied almost exclusively by Germans -- more than 600 of them.<p> Only 25 of the 700 guests at the hotel were English. Barnish had paid &#163;4,000 for the holiday.

      This is the only song that brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it - for very personal as well social cohesion reasons. Apart from the lack of sisters, the lyrics express the ET philosophy - for me.<p>
      I don't like this tricksy video. The original track on the 'White City' album, with the intrusion from madman Ron Geesin 'It's all going to end in fire', is IMO definitive.
